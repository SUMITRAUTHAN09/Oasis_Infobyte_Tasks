      <p class="para">Ferruccio Lamborghini, born on April 28, 1916, in Cento, Italy, was an influential entrepreneur and founder of Lamborghini, the world-renowned luxury sports car brand. 
        Initially, Lamborghini built his fortune in the agricultural sector, founding Lamborghini Trattori in 1948, a successful tractor manufacturing company. 
        His keen business acumen allowed him to expand into other industries, including air-conditioning and heating systems. 
        Lamborghini's passion for high-performance cars, combined with dissatisfaction with his Ferrari, led him to establish Automobili Lamborghini in 1963. 
        His goal was to create a refined, powerful alternative to Ferrari, which he achieved with groundbreaking models like the Lamborghini Miura. 
        Ferruccio's legacy is defined by his relentless pursuit of perfection, blending engineering brilliance with luxury, and leaving an indelible mark on the automotive industry. 
        He passed away on February 20, 1993, but his brand continues to symbolize innovation and prestige.</p>
